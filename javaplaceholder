This folder is for Part 3: The Java Build Server (The "Industrial Forge").
This will be a separate project (e.g., a Java Spring Boot app)
that you also deploy to Google Cloud Run.
It will have ONE job:
Receive mainJava and pluginYml text from an API call.
Run the real javac and jar commands.
Return the final .jar file.
You can build this as your advanced "Version 2.0" feature.
