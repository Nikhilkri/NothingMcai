Nothing AI - Minecraft Plugin Generator
(Vercel-Only, No Credit Card Version)
This project is 100% free and requires no credit card.
It is deployed using only GitHub and Vercel.
1. The Architecture
Code Repository: GitHub (This repository)
All Hosting: Vercel (Hobby Plan)
Vercel hosts:
The frontend (index.html, script.js)
The backend (the api/ folder) as Serverless Functions.
2. How to Deploy
GitHub: Create this repository and push all these files.
Vercel:
Sign up for Vercel (free, no card) with your GitHub account.
Create a "New Project" and select this repository.
DO NOT change the "Root Directory." Leave it at the default.
Vercel will automatically find the package.json and api folder.
Add your Environment Variable: Go to the project's "Settings" -> "Environment Variables".
Add your GEMINI_API_KEY (just like you did in CodeSandbox).
Click "Deploy."
Your website is now 100% live. The frontend and backend are all in one place.
